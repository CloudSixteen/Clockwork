Open-Source Clockwork
---------
A roleplaying framework developed by Cloud Sixteen for the people.  
Open-source version of Clockwork uses decrypted source code and cracked CloudAuthX binaries to be able to load schemas properly. Feel free to use, edit and create your own schemas freely.
*Clockwork was created and is under development by Conna Wiles, also known as kurozael.*
